# Requirements
## Introduction
  As we are human we need to act upon the cause and consequence. A car is a massive machine with around 30 thousand parts and it produces enormous output power. In case of car, cause is accelerating a car which increases the speed this is one of the car's important characteristics but the cause may end in both positive and negative ways that is consequence. To monitor the consequences the Console is used. If an error occurs in a car it is really difficult to diagnose where the error occured. On considering the mentioned points it is must to use a console in a car.  

## Research

I have attached my final year project in which I am going to implement this C-programming mini project. 


## Cost and Features and Timeline

I have attached the link to the 3 Dimentional graph of CFT(cost, Feature, Timeline) 
where, X axis represents cost in 1000 RS per unit, Y axis represents Features in points per unit, Z axis represents time in days per unit.


## Defining Our System, 

   The considered system is an application which can be implemented in 4_Wheelers 
## SWOT ANALYSIS

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:

The people with the car and any 4-Wheeler can use this Console by changing the boundary values accordingly.

## What:

Car Console is a device which monitors and displays the function of the car and Error message if error occurs

## When:

This product car console is used when the driver of car need to know the speed or the functionality of the car.

## Where:

Only in the 4-Wheeler this product can be aoolicable.

## How:

This product can be mounted in front of the driver so that the driver will have the knowledge of the performance of the car.
