## Introduction
  As we are human we need to act upon the cause and consequence. A car is a massive machine with around 30 thousand parts and it produces enormous output power. In case of car cause is accelerating a car which increases the speed this is one of the car's important characteristics but the cause may end in both positive and negative ways that is consequence. To monitor the consequences the Console is used. If an error occurs in a car it is really difficult to diagnose where the error occured. On considering the mentioned points it is must to use a console in a car.
